### About me
At this moment I am a beginner in programming.  The idea to study this sphere appeared quite unexpectedly, but in a short period of education I am already making great progress. 
About myself I can say the following - I am a very responsible and intelligent person. Studying at medical university and working with people has taught me to be patient and emotionally tough. I am willing to learn a lot of new information in order to become a professional in programming. 

Currently I have no work experience in it field, but I will do everything possible to fix it as soon as possible.
